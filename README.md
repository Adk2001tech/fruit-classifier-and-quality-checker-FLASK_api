## Overview
* **Simple Flask app fitted with Deep Conv. neural network model which is able to distinguish between real world images of Apples, Bananas, Oranges with predicting weather the fruit in image is Fresh or Rotten with respective probabilities.**<br>
* **Data to train this DNN is collected in (`/data`) folder, which is done with the help of google search and downloading each image from it. This section is more explored in  'Data collection' topic below**

## Motivation/Purpose
After completing the 4th course(CNN) of deep learning specialization. I was super excited to implement the knowledge I gained in practical and productional way by doing an **end to end project** with following purposes.
1. This application/technique can be applied to **material selection procedure** in productional sector of companies making... 
<ul>
	<li>Fruit juices</li>
	<li>Pickles</li>
	<li>Tomato sauces</li>
	<li>etc. in commercial scale.</li>
</ul>
2.  Want to give enlightenment to beginners in learning flask as well as to train DNN and hypertune it to get better performance !<br>
3. Want to make more advancement in this project to serve the dealers who work in food checking & transportation, So they can monitor/check the condition of their stock at any time they want.
